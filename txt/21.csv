Krothapalli Sreenivasa Rao,Associate Professor,ksrao@sit.iitkgp.ernet.in,91-3222-282336,http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=bYmWU,"For the last 16 years I have been working on signal processing and machine learning aspects, targeted to mainly speech applications. In collaboration with Govt. of India (DIT, MCIT, DST) and other premium technological institutes of India, we have developed various speech systems in Indian languages. During the initial period of my career my focus was on acquisition and incorporation of prosody for developing various speech systems. Later my focus has been shifted to (i) expressive speech analysis/synthesis, (ii) development of robust speech systems, (iii) vocal folds activity analysis and syntheis in view of speecha nd biomedical applications, (iv) development of appropriate signal processing methods to extract the characteristic features from Hindustani music and (v) big-data analysis framework and audio and multimedia analytics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
