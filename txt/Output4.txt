My research interest revolves around different aspects of networks, ranging from social networks to smartphone devices. In the social network context, we focus on the different online, location based and event based social network datasets and investigate the influence of information diffusion on the popularity of different stakeholders such as tweet, businesses and groups. In the mobile context, we leverage on the userâs smartphone engagement to recognize her physical activities, group activities as well as to detect the emotional state of the user.
