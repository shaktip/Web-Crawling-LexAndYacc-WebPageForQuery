The main research interest of Dr. Das is computational number theory with applications to public-key cryptography and public-key cryptanalysis. He is also interested in efficient implementations of algorithms of interest in computational number theory and public-key cryptology. Some specific research areas of Dr. Das are algorithms for integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem, elliptic-curve and pairing-based cryptography, cryptographic protocols in mobile and ad hoc networks, algebraic attacks, and massively parallel implementations of cryptographic and cryptanalytic algorithms.
