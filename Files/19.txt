----------
I work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am interested in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods to different domains. I have been working with Natural Language Processing of Indian languages, information retrieval and recommendation systems and text mining applications. I am interested in using Machine learning methods to tasks related to climate modelling and prediction. I have been interested in doing analytics of mobility data. We have been working on applications in the domain of transportation and logistics.
